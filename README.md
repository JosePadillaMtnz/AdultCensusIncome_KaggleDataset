# Kaggle Dataset on Adult Census Income

A study of data from the Kaggle adult census income dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income/data), looking for patterns, behaviors, and information that may be useful. Throughout the document, different sections can be seen, highlighting the EDA part and the creation and evaluation of models.

The Exploratory Data Analysis part searches for patterns between, relationships, and feature cleaning. The model part creates different model options with both both Random Forest and Decision Tree, and also deleting the irrelevant features in the prediction, to finally obtain metrics.
